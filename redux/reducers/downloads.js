 * @param {Object***REMOVED*** action - Parameters passed from groupActions.js functions.
 * @param {Object***REMOVED*** downloads - (state) All of the currently active downloads. Each key is the ID of the lesson that is downloading so that multiple lesson downloads can be stored at once.
 * @param {number***REMOVED*** downloads[key].progress - The progress of this lesson's download from 0 to 1.
 * @param {Object***REMOVED*** downloads[key].resumable - The resumable object for this lesson's download saved from the expo download object. This is stored so that we can "cancel" the download later. In this case, cancelling means pausing the download and never resuming it since expo doesn't have a cancel download function.

 * The groups redux reducer stores all the information related to groups. This state is persisted across app restarts.
 * @param {Object} params - Parameters passed from groupActions.js functions.
 * @param {Object[]} groups - (state) Stores all the created groups in an array.
 * @param {string} groups[].name - The name of the group.
 * @param {number} groups[].id - The unique ID for the group.
 * @param {string} groups[].language - The language ID associated with the group.
 * @param {string} groups[].emoji - The name of the emoji used for this group's avatar. Called 'default' by default.
 * @param {string} groups[].recentCoreOrTool - The ID of the most recent foundational or mobilization tools set that has completed a lesson. Note: the name is outdated.
 * @param {string} groups[].setBookmark - The ID of the bookmarked set for this group.
 * @param {boolean} groups[].shouldShowMobilizationToolsTab - Whether the mobilization tools tab should show on the story sets screen.
 * @param {Object[]} groups[].addedSets - An array of sets that have been 'added' to this group. The first 2 foundational sets are added automatically upon creating a new group.
 * @param {string} groups[].addedSet[].id - The ID of the added set.
 * @param {number[]} groups[].addedSet[].progress - Stores the progress for this particular set. Each element is a number for the index of the lesson that has been completed. A set with 0 completed lessons would have an empty progress array.
 * @param {number} groups[].addedSet[].bookmark - The index
